# Challenge C05: Homepage

This is the homepage of the *Jobsity Bookshelf*, with the main layout being **pixel perfect** according to the initial design. There are some sample books displayed with highly adaptable **responsive design** for all screen sizes and devices so the web can be enjoyed from anywhere. Also, all the information of the books, including the cover, was taken from the Google API using **JSON and AJAX** for the HTTP requests, so the info will be always reliable.

## Developer Mode

Last but not least, As a *brand-new feature*, if the *Bookshelf* title is clicked more than 5 times, it will display a temporary **developer mode**, in which a new book can be added at the end by entering its ISBN or either the last book can be removed and so a preview of modifications can be seen.
