# Challenge C04: Create a piano player

This is the *Pianapp*, a web application built using **CSS & HTML** for the design and **vanilla JavaScript** for the functionality, implementing **event listeners** for cklicking, key-pressing and tapping the piano keys.

## PIANAPP

This web app encourages the user to play simple sets of musical notes shown in a pentagram by clicking, tapping or key-pressing (using the letter guides) the piano keys in order to get a piece of song with its piece of lyrics appearing on the screen as soon as a correct note is played. Once the user successfully reach the end of the set of notes, an additional note sound will make the full song play on the background.

Enjoy this beta. I will be happy to read your comments/suggestions.
